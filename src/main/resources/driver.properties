user=Database user name
password=Password of database user
database=Database
socketFactory=to use a custom socket factory, set it to the full name of the class that implements javax.net.SocketFactory.
connectTimeout=The connect timeout value, in milliseconds, or zero for no timeout.
pipe=On Windows, specify named pipe name to connect.
localSocket=Permits connecting to the database via Unix domain socket, if the server allows it. The value is the path of Unix domain socket (i.e "socket" database parameter : select @@socket)
tcpKeepAlive=Sets corresponding option on the connection socket.
tcpAbortiveClose=This option can be used in environments where connections are created and closed in rapid succession. Often, it is not possible to create a socket in such an environment after a while, since all local “ephemeral” ports are used up by TCP connections in TCP_WAIT state. Using tcpAbortiveClose works around this problem by resetting TCP connections (abortive or hard close) rather than doing an orderly close. It is accomplished by using socket.setSoLinger(true,0) for abortive close
localSocketAddress=Hostname or IP address to bind the connection socket to a local (UNIX domain) socket.
socketTimeout=Defined the network socket timeout (SO_TIMEOUT) in milliseconds. Value of 0 disables this timeout.If the goal is to set a timeout for all queries, since MariaDB 10.1.1, the server has permitted a solution to limit the query time by setting a system variable, max_statement_time. The advantage is that the connection then is still usable. Default: 0ms.
allowMultiQueries=permit multi-queries like insert into ab (i) values (1); insert into ab (i) values (2). Default: false.
rewriteBatchedStatements=PrepareStatement are prepared on the server side before executing. The applications that repeatedly use the same queries have value to activate this option, but the general case is to use the direct command (text protocol). if rewriteBatchedStatements is set to true, this option will be set to false
useCompression=Compresses the exchange with the database through gzip. This permits better performance when the database is not in the same location.
blankTableNameMeta=Resultset metadata getTableName always return blank. This option is mainly for ORACLE db compatibility.
credentialType=Indicate the credential plugin type to use. Plugin must be present in classpath
sslMode=Indicate SSL demand. Possible value disable, no-verification (no certificate and hostname validation), verify-ca (Encryption, certificates validation, BUT no hostname verification), verify-full (Standard SSL use: Encryption, certificate validation and hostname)
enabledSslCipherSuites=Force TLS/SSL cipher (comma separated list). Example : "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
sessionVariables=<var>=<value> pairs separated by comma, mysql session variables, set upon establishing successful connection.
tinyInt1isBit=Datatype mapping flag, handle MySQL Tiny as BIT(boolean).
yearIsDateType=Year is date type, rather than numerical.
dumpQueriesOnException=If set to 'true', an exception is thrown during query execution containing a query string.
prepStmtCacheSize=if useServerPrepStmts = true, defines the prepared statement cache size that option `cachePrepStmts` use. Default: 250
useAffectedRows=If false (default), use "found rows" for the row count of statements. This corresponds to the JDBC standard. If true, use "affected rows" for the row count. This changes the behavior of, for example, UPDATE... ON DUPLICATE KEY statements.
useServerPrepStmts=PrepareStatement are prepared on the server side before executing. The applications that repeatedly use the same queries have value to activate this option, but the general case is to use the direct command (text protocol). if rewriteBatchedStatements is set to true, this option will be set to false
connectionAttributes=When performance_schema is active, permit to send server some client information in a key;value pair format (example: connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2,value2). Those informations can be retrieved on server within tables performance_schema.session_connect_attrs and performance_schema.session_account_connect_attrs. This can permit from server an identification of client/application
useBulkStmts=Use dedicated COM_STMT_BULK_EXECUTE protocol for batch insert when possible. (batch without Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS and streams) to have faster batch. (significant only on >= MariaDB 10.2.7). Default: false.
autocommit=Set default autocommit value on connection initialization. Default: true.
includeInnodbStatusInDeadlockExceptions=add "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS" result to exception trace when having a deadlock exception.
includeThreadDumpInDeadlockExceptions=add thread dump to exception trace when having a deadlock exception.
servicePrincipalName=When using GSSAPI authentication, use this value as the Service Principal Name (SPN) instead of the one defined for the user account on the database server.
defaultFetchSize=The driver will call setFetchSize(n) with this value on all newly-created Statements. Default: 0.
tlsSocketType=Indicate the TLS org.mariadb.jdbc.tls.TlsSocketPlugin plugin type to use. Plugin must be present in classpath
maxQuerySizeToLog=Only the first characters corresponding to this options size will be displayed in logs. Default: 1024
retriesAllDown=When the connector is performing a failover and all hosts are down, this parameter defines the maximum number of connection attempts the connector will make before throwing an exception. Default: 120 seconds.
assureReadOnly=When this parameter enabled when a Failover and Load Balancing Mode is in use, and a read-only connection is made to a host, assure that this connection is in read-only mode by setting the session to read-only. Default to false.
validConnectionTimeout=When multiple hosts are configured, the connector verifies that the connections haven't been lost after this much time in seconds has elapsed. When this parameter is set to 0, no verification will be done. Default:120 seconds
loadBalanceBlacklistTimeout=When a connection fails, this host will be blacklisted for the amount of time defined by this parameter. When connecting to a host, the driver will try to connect to a host in the list of non-blacklisted hosts and, only if none are found, attempt blacklisted ones. This blacklist is shared inside the classloader. Default: 50 seconds.
failoverLoopRetries=When the connector is searching silently for a valid host, this parameter defines the maximum number of connection attempts the connector will make before throwing an exception. This parameter differs from the "retriesAllDown" parameter because this silent search is used in situations where the connector can temporarily workaround the problem, such as by using the master connection to execute reads when the slave connection fails. Default: 120.
galeraAllowedState=Usually, Connection.isValid just send an empty packet to server, and server send a small response to ensure connectivity. When this option is set, connector will ensure Galera server state "wsrep_local_state" correspond to allowed values (separated by comma). example "4,5", recommended is "4". see galera state to know more.
enabledSslProtocolSuites=Force TLS/SSL protocol to a specific set of TLS versions (comma separated list). Example : "TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2"
pinGlobalTxToPhysicalConnection=
pool=Use pool. This option is useful only if not using a DataSource object, but only a connection object. Default: false.
poolName=Pool name that permits identifying threads. default: auto-generated as MariaDb-pool-<pool-index>
maxPoolSize=The maximum number of physical connections that the pool should contain. Default: 8.
minPoolSize=When connections are removed due to not being used for longer than than "maxIdleTime", connections are closed and removed from the pool. "minPoolSize" indicates the number of physical connections the pool should keep available at all times. Should be less or equal to maxPoolSize.
maxIdleTime=The maximum amount of time in seconds that a connection can stay in the pool when not used. This value must always be below @wait_timeout value - 45s. Default: 600 in seconds (=10 minutes), minimum value is 60 seconds.
staticGlobal=Indicates the values of the global variables max_allowed_packet, wait_timeout, autocommit, auto_increment_increment, time_zone, system_time_zone and tx_isolation) won't be changed, permitting the pool to create new connections faster. Default: false.
registerJmxPool=Register JMX monitoring pools. Default: true. 
poolValidMinDelay=When asking a connection to pool, the pool will validate the connection state. "poolValidMinDelay" permits disabling this validation if the connection has been borrowed recently avoiding useless verifications in case of frequent reuse of connections. 0 means validation is done each time the connection is asked. Default: 1000 (in milliseconds). 
useResetConnection=When a connection is closed() (given back to pool), the pool resets the connection state. Setting this option, the prepare command will be deleted, session variables changed will be reset, and user variables will be destroyed when the server permits it (>= MariaDB 10.2.4, >= MySQL 5.7.3), permitting saving memory on the server if the application make extensive use of variables. Must not be used with the useServerPrepStmts option. Default: false. 
serverSslCert=Permits providing server's certificate in DER form, or server's CA certificate. The server will be added to trustStor. This permits a self-signed certificate to be trusted. Can be used in one of 3 forms : * serverSslCert=/path/to/cert.pem (full path to certificate) * serverSslCert=classpath:relative/cert.pem (relative to current classpath) * or as verbatim DER-encoded certificate string "------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" .
serverRsaPublicKeyFile=Indicate path to RSA server public key file for sha256_password and caching_sha2_password authentication password
allowPublicKeyRetrieval=Authorize client to retrieve RSA server public key when serverRsaPublicKeyFile is not set (for sha256_password and caching_sha2_password authentication password). Default: false. 
useReadAheadInput=use a buffered inputSteam that read socket available data. This cost a bit more in CPU, but permit returning result-set faster. Default true
cachePrepStmts=enable/disable prepare Statement cache. When enable, PreparedStatement.close won't close prepare immediately, keeping a pool of most used prepared results. Default true.
timezone=Driver set connection timezone to client timezone. Value default to client default time-zone ID, but can be set using this option. If you are sure that server use the same timezone, setting connection timezone can be disabled using value 'disable'.
maxAllowedPacket=give driver server max_allowed_packet, to avoid querying server when establishing a connection.
transactionReplay=When having a failover, can current transaction beeing re-executed, having a completly transparent failover. All commands must be idempotent. Default false.
