user=Database user name
password=Password of database user
database=Database
socketFactory=to use a custom socket factory, set it to the full name of the class that implements javax.net.SocketFactory.
connectTimeout=The connect timeout value, in milliseconds, or zero for no timeout.
pipe=On Windows, specify named pipe name to connect.
localSocket=Permits connecting to the database via Unix domain socket, if the server allows it. The value is the path of Unix domain socket (i.e "socket" database parameter : select @@socket)
tcpKeepAlive=Sets corresponding option on the connection socket. Default: True
tcpAbortiveClose=This option can be used in environments where connections are created and closed in rapid succession. Often, it is not possible to create a socket in such an environment after a while, since all local �ephemeral� ports are used up by TCP connections in TCP_WAIT state. Using tcpAbortiveClose works around this problem by resetting TCP connections (abortive or hard close) rather than doing an orderly close. It is accomplished by using socket.setSoLinger(true,0) for abortive close
localSocketAddress=Hostname or IP address to bind the connection socket to a local (UNIX domain) socket.
socketTimeout=Defined the network socket timeout (SO_TIMEOUT) in milliseconds. Value of 0 disables this timeout.If the goal is to set a timeout for all queries, since MariaDB 10.1.1, the server has permitted a solution to limit the query time by setting a system variable, max_statement_time. The advantage is that the connection then is still usable. Default: 0ms.
allowMultiQueries=permit multi-queries like insert into ab (i) values (1); insert into ab (i) values (2). Default: false.
useCompression=Compresses the exchange with the database through gzip. This permits better performance when the database is not in the same location.

prepStmtCacheSize=if useServerPrepStmts = true, defines the prepared statement cache size that option `cachePrepStmts` use. Default: 250
useAffectedRows=If false (default), use "found rows" for the row count of statements. This corresponds to the JDBC standard. If true, use "affected rows" for the row count. This changes the behavior of, for example, UPDATE... ON DUPLICATE KEY statements.
useServerPrepStmts=PrepareStatement are prepared on the server side before executing. The applications that repeatedly use the same queries have value to activate this option, but the general case is to use the direct command (text protocol).
connectionAttributes=When performance_schema is active, permit to send server some client information in a key;value pair format (example: connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2,value2). Those informations can be retrieved on server within tables performance_schema.session_connect_attrs and performance_schema.session_account_connect_attrs. This can permit from server an identification of client/application
useBulkStmts=Use dedicated COM_STMT_BULK_EXECUTE protocol for batch insert when possible. (batch without Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS and streams) to have faster batch. (significant only on >= MariaDB 10.2.7). Default: false.

includeThreadDumpInDeadlockExceptions=add thread dump to exception trace when having a deadlock exception.
servicePrincipalName=When using GSSAPI authentication, use this value as the Service Principal Name (SPN) instead of the one defined for the user account on the database server.
defaultFetchSize=The driver will call setFetchSize(n) with this value on all newly-created Statements. Default: 0.
tlsSocketType=Indicate the TLS org.mariadb.jdbc.tls.TlsSocketPlugin plugin type to use. Plugin must be present in classpath
maxQuerySizeToLog=Only the first characters corresponding to this options size will be displayed in logs. Default: 1024
retriesAllDown=When the connector is performing a failover and all hosts are down, this parameter defines the maximum number of connection attempts the connector will make before throwing an exception. Default: 120 seconds.
galeraAllowedState=Usually, Connection.isValid just send an empty packet to server, and server send a small response to ensure connectivity. When this option is set, connector will ensure Galera server state "wsrep_local_state" correspond to allowed values (separated by comma). example "4,5", recommended is "4". see galera state to know more.
enabledSslProtocolSuites=Force TLS/SSL protocol to a specific set of TLS versions (comma separated list). Example : "TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2"

maxPoolSize=The maximum number of physical connections that the pool should contain. Default: 8.
minPoolSize=When connections are removed due to not being used for longer than than "maxIdleTime", connections are closed and removed from the pool. "minPoolSize" indicates the number of physical connections the pool should keep available at all times. Should be less or equal to maxPoolSize.
maxIdleTime=The maximum amount of time in seconds that a connection can stay in the pool when not used. This value must always be below @wait_timeout value - 45s. Default: 600 in seconds (=10 minutes), minimum value is 60 seconds.
registerJmxPool=Register JMX monitoring pools. Default: true.
poolValidMinDelay=When asking a connection to pool, the pool will validate the connection state. "poolValidMinDelay" permits disabling this validation if the connection has been borrowed recently avoiding useless verifications in case of frequent reuse of connections. 0 means validation is done each time the connection is asked. Default: 1000 (in milliseconds).
useResetConnection=When a connection is closed() (given back to pool), the pool resets the connection state. Setting this option, the prepare command will be deleted, session variables changed will be reset, and user variables will be destroyed when the server permits it (>= MariaDB 10.2.4, >= MySQL 5.7.3), permitting saving memory on the server if the application make extensive use of variables. Must not be used with the useServerPrepStmts option. Default: false.
serverSslCert=Permits providing server's certificate in DER form, or server's CA certificate. The server will be added to trustStor. This permits a self-signed certificate to be trusted. Can be used in one of 3 forms : * serverSslCert=/path/to/cert.pem (full path to certificate) * serverSslCert=classpath:relative/cert.pem (relative to current classpath) * or as verbatim DER-encoded certificate string "------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" .

useReadAheadInput=use a buffered inputSteam that read socket available data. This cost a bit more in CPU, but permit returning result-set faster. Default true
cachePrepStmts=enable/disable prepare Statement cache. When enable, PreparedStatement.close won't close prepare immediately, keeping a pool of most used prepared results. Default true.
timezone=permits to force session timezone in case of client having a different timezone compare to server. The option `timezone` can have 3 types of value: 'disabled' (default) : connector doesn't change time_zone. '<a timezone>': connector will set connection variable to value. see timezone consideration tp know more
transactionReplay=When having a failover, can current transaction being re-executed, having a completely transparent failover. All commands must be idempotent. Default false.
transactionReplaySize=replay cache buffer maximum size. If a transaction has more command that this size and a failover occurs, transaction will then not be replayed, just throwing an exception error. (Integer) default 64.
allowLocalInfile=Indicate if LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE commands are permitted. This will disable all pipelining implementation. Default false.
geometryDefaultType=Indicate what default Object type Geometry a resultset.getObject must return. null or empty is WKB byte array. 'default' will return org.mariadb.mariadb.jdbc.type Object. Default null
keyStore=File path of the keyStore file that contain client private key store and associate certificates (similar to java System property "javax.net.ssl.keyStore", but ensure that only the private key's entries are used)
keyStorePassword="Password for the client certificate keyStore (similar to java System property "javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword")
keyPassword="Password for the client certificate keyStore alias

initSql=Initial command to execute on new connection creation
transformedBitIsBoolean=Indicate for TINYINT(1) in column metadata that type is BOOLEAN in place of BIT 
disablePipeline=option permitting disabling pipelining
uuidAsString=must uuid fields return as String and not java.util.UUID when using getObject()
useCatalogTerm="schema" and "database" are server synonymous. Connector historically get/set database using Connection.setCatalog()/getCatalog(), setSchema()/getSchema() being no-op. This parameter indicate to change that behavior to use Schema in place of Catalog. Behavior will change 1: database change will be done with either Connection.setCatalog()/getCatalog() or Connection.setSchema()/getSchema(), 2: DatabaseMetadata methods that use catalog or schema filtering, 3: ResultsetMetadata database will be retrieved
useLocalSessionState=indicate if connector can use local state to avoid unnecessary queries. This means application must use JDBC dedicated methods, like connection.setTransactionIsolation and never queries like "SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL X" directly
useBulkStmtsForInserts=use Bulk batch for insert only. This permits to ensure returning expected affected rows and not Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO. This option is enabled when useBulkStmts is enabled
returnMultiValuesGeneratedIds=For compatibility with 2.x MariaDB connector. This permit to return generated ids from multi-values insert
jdbcCompliantTruncation=If set, the connector ensures STRICT_TRANS_TABLES is always set to follow JDBC expected truncation. Default is not set, since it will add a new command for each connection and strict mode is already the server default.
permitRedirect=permit server redirection. Default is true
fallbackToSystemKeyStore=Indicate if keystore default implementation can be used. Connector use keystore option if set or if not, use javax.net.ssl.keyStore* system properties to load keystore if this option is enable

nullDatabaseMeansCurrent=When enable, in DatabaseMetadata, will handle null database/schema (depending on UseCatalog=catalog/schema) as current. (Alias nullCatalogMeansCurrent)
preserveInstants= This option controls whether the connector converts Timestamp values to the connection's time zone.
connectionTimeZone=This option defines the connection's time zone. LOCAL retrieves the JVM's default time zone, SERVER fetches the server's global time zone upon connection creation, and <user-defined time zone> allows specifying a server time zone without requesting it during connection establishment.
forceConnectionTimeZoneToSession=This setting dictates whether the connector enforces the connection time zone for the session.
pinGlobalTxToPhysicalConnection=When set, will reuse reuse previous connection used for XID.
